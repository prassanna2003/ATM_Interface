The ATM interface is a software project that aims to create a system for simulating the operations of an automated teller machine (ATM). The project consists of the following components:

- An ATM class that represents the ATM machine. This class has attributes such as the current balance, the PIN number, and the user's bank account. The class also has methods to perform various operations on the ATM, such as withdrawing, depositing, checking the balance, and changing the PIN.
- A user interface for the ATM. This can be either a console-based interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Swing or JavaFX. The user interface allows the user to interact with the ATM by providing options such as withdrawing, depositing, checking the balance, changing the PIN, and exiting the system.
- A BankAccount class that represents the user's bank account. This class stores the account balance and provides methods to access and modify the balance.
- A connection between the ATM class and the BankAccount class. This allows the ATM to access and modify the user's bank account balance based on the user's input and the ATM's operations.
- A validation mechanism to ensure that the user input is within acceptable limits. For example, the user cannot withdraw more than the available balance, the user cannot enter an invalid PIN, and the user cannot enter a negative amount for depositing or withdrawing.
- A display mechanism to show appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure of their transactions. For example, the system displays the updated balance after a successful withdrawal or deposit, the system displays an error message if the user enters an incorrect PIN, and the system displays a confirmation message if the user changes their PIN.

The project uses Java as the programming language and follows the object-oriented design principles. The project also includes documentation and testing of the system.
